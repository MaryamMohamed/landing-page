## Introduction
This project is part of Udacity Nanodegree in Web Development Track that granted by Egypt FWD.
In this project, we build a landing page that uses JavaScript to create an interactive navigational experience for the user.

## Architecture
css
- styles.css    
index.html
js
- app.js
README.md

## Features
1. The implementation of responsiveness of the website is aptly implemented.
2. There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.
3. Styling has been added for the active states.

## Behavior
1. Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty ul and dynamically build navigation using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML.
2. It's clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
3. When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

## Some using methods and functions

- appendChild
- innerHTML
- getBoundingClientRect
- addEventListener(‘click’, ...)
- preventDefault()
- scroll()
